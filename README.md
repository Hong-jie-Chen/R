Code Availability Statement
This code contains the data cleaning and the vast majority of the statistical analyses from Sleep Duration Impacts Frailty Risk Trajectories via Cognition and Depression in Middle-Aged and Older Adults (cohort trajectory analysis, baseline feature analysis, multiple logistic regression analysis, restricted cubic spline analysis, and subgroup analysis).
After my test, the code can run successfully on my local computer, but on other computer devices, there may be a case where the code runs incorrectly due to the working path or the original file being missing.
Therefore, it is recommended that you first register and request the original data in the official CHARLS website before viewing and replicating the process and subsequently analyzing it with this code.（CHARLS official websit: https://charls.pku.edu.cn/）
